# NetworkHealth
The Agentic AI Network &amp; System Health Monitor is a Python-based tool designed to provide real-time monitoring of key system and network performance metrics. It leverages locally running Ollama language models to analyze these metrics, identify potential anomalies, and provide concise, color-coded status updates or alerts directly in the terminal.

The project acts as an intelligent Digital Shadow of your computer's network and system health. It mirrors the real-time status of the physical system through automated data collection and uses AI to interpret that status, but it doesn't interact back to control the system.
